# Installing pyRedunda

To install pyRedunda, one needs to have Python 3 and pip3 installed on their computer.

Once they have been installed, run the following command:

    pip3 install pyRedunda --user

or run

    sudo -H pip3 install pyRedunda

Use the former for a per-user install, while the former for a global install.

Once this is done, one can import it using

    import pyRedunda
